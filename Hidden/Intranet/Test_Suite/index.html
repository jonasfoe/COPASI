The test suite is designed to test the software for a number of features. The suite will be composed of COPASI files (or SBML or Gepasi format) accompanied by a file that has a short description of the purpose of the test and the expected outcomes.<br />
<br />
We antecipate that the test suite will focus on the following aspects:<br />
<ul><li> accuracy of calculations
</li><li> speed of calculations
</li><li> ability to read file formats
</li></ul>
<br />
Each test should contain a set of files with the same basename. The basename should be descriptive but not too long and contain only alphanumeric characters and underline and dash. Some type of input or output may contain several files, for example a test may write out several report files, or there could be several files with data for fitting; in those cases these files will have a number after the basename separated by a dot. The tests will often consist of a COPASI run that produces output file that are then to be matched against supplied target output files (ie what we expect COPASI to write).<br />
<br />
For numerical comparisons, which must only match within some predefined tolerances we use an <a  href="ndiff-2.00-copasi.tar.gz&amp;page=TestSuiteIntro" rel="">enhanced version of ndiff</a>. This version only reports errors which are larger than given absolute and relative errors simultaneously.<br />
<br />
The files should primarily be added to the CVS and then also to this page (which may be automated in some way).<br />
<br />
There should be at least two files for each test: a description file named <i>basename.dsc</i> and the file to load into COPASI, which commonly will be <i>basename.cps</i> but could also be <i>basename.xml</i> or <i>basename.gps</i>.  In many cases there may be extra files, for example a file with targeted output eg. <i>basename.1.txt.tgt</i> or an input data file for fitting <i>basename.1.dat</i>.<br />

Template for the description file:<br />
<div class="simplebox"><pre>TITLE HERE

summary of the purpose of this test; this template shows where 
text goes: where there is an empty line you need to have a blank 
line (separator of fields). Please do not leave any other empty
lines. (at the end list only the output files to be created, not 
the target files)

short description of the expected outcome, this is not the actual
numbers as those are to be included in the target files. However 
if the test is for speed, for example, the target desired value 
should be clearly stated in this paragraph

Creator and date

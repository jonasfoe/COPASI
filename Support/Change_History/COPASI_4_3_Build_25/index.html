<h3 name="span_style_color_000088_Version_4_3_Build_25_span_"><span style="color:#000088;">Version 4.3 (Build 25)</span></h3>
Release Date: March 12, 2008<br />
<h4 name="New_Features">New Features</h4>
<ul><li> Model
<ul><li> Metabolites are now called Species, in line with the terminology used in SBML.
</li><li> The scope of local reaction parameters is now limited to the reaction which defines them. This is in line with the SBML specifications.
</li></ul></li><li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
<ul><li> Improved display and reporting of mass conservation analysis results.
</li></ul></li><li>  Command Line (CopasiSE)
<ul><li> Added a mass conservation analysis task has been added to the command line version.
</li><li> Added option --nologo, which suppresses COPASI version and license statement.
</li><li> Added option --validate, which only validates the input files (CopasiML, Gepasi, or SBML).
</li></ul></li><li> SBML
<ul><li> Import SBML Level 1 Version 1, 2 and Level 2 Version 1 - 3.
</li><li> Export SBML Level 1 Version 2 and Level 2 Version 1 - 3.
</li><li> Added support for initial assignments.
</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4 name="Bug_Fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul><li> Results
<ul><li> A bug that produced incorrect stochastic simulation results in models with changing volumes has been fixed.
</li><li> Fixed problem calculating Jacobian and MCA for SBML models whose reaction kinetics were defined without explicit  dependence on species (ie through expressions that involved these species).
</li><li> Fixed numerical problem in stochastic simulations, which could interrupt the integration.
</li><li> Improved numerical differentiation, which would lead to incorrect results for changing compartment volumes close to zero.
</li></ul></li><li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
<ul><li> Fixed occasional access violation when closing COPASI under Windows.
</li><li> Fixed problem where changes to local parameter in the reaction display were occasionally ignored.
</li><li> Models with circular dependencies can now be saved.
</li><li> The histograms have now the correct bin size for the bin at zero.
</li><li> The time series displayed in the time course and optimization result does no show the values for the individual task instead of the result of the last executed task.
</li><li> Changes to the mapping of the kinetic function parameters in the reaction display are now preserved when the reaction is committed.
</li><li> Changes to the initial particle number of species are now preserved.
</li><li> The MathML saved in the ODE display is now a valid XML document.
</li><li> Fixed the scaling of plots, which failed when the first value to be displayed was missing or invalid.
</li><li> Fixed problem editing initial values when disabling an initial assignment.
</li><li> Fixed occasional crash when enabling an initial assignment.
</li><li> Added a column for initial assignments to the tables of compartments, species, and model quantities.
</li><li> Saving extremely large time series in memory will no longer lead to a crash. Instead an error message will be displayed.
</li><li> The time series shows now the correct species concentration for models with changing compartment volumes.
</li><li> Fixed occasional crash occurring when constraints are used in optimization or parameter estimation.
</li><li> The object selection for constraints show now additionally transient values.
</li><li> Results are now cleared when a new model is created or loaded avoiding confusion and occasional crashes.
</li><li> The quantity conversion factor can now be used in initial assignments and has been added to the object selection.
</li><li> Disabled editing the initial concentration for metabolites where this would lead to circular dependencies due assignment rules for the containing compartment.
</li></ul></li><li>  Command Line (CopasiSE)
<ul><li> Error messages are now printed to std::error when CopasiSE fails.
</li><li> The --verbose options prints now all internal messages whether they are errors or not to std::out.
</li></ul></li><li> SBML
<ul><li> Fixed problem importing compartments without the volume attribute set from SBML level 1.
</li><li> Export of models using COPASI's uniform and normal distribution functions will create now proper error messages
</li><li> Species with the hasOnlySubstanceUnits flag set to true are now handled correctly in kinetic laws.
</li><li> Fixed problem where every second SBML export failed.
</li><li> Improved export of models with changing compartment volumes.
</li><li> Fixed import and export of piecewise defined mathematical expressions.
</li></ul></li><li> ODE Export
<ul><li> The C code export of models using COPASI's uniform and normal distribution functions expects the user to provide these functions instead of failing the export.
</li></ul></li></ul>

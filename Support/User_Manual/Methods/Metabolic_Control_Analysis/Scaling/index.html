COPASI calculates (non-normalized) elasticity coefficients by numerical derivation with finite differences. To calculate control coefficients from steady-state data, COPASI applies the method described in [<a title="COPASI: Support/User Manual/Bibliography" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/User_Manual/Bibliography#Reder88" >Reder88</a>]. This method works with the reduced system where some variables are eliminated using conservation relations (see <a title="COPASI: Support/User Manual/The Model in COPASI/Deterministic Interpretation of the Model" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/User_Manual/The_Model_in_COPASI/Deterministic_Interpretation_of_the_Model" >Deterministic Interpretation of the Model</a>). All coefficients are obtained unscaled by this method and are scaled with the appropriate steady state concentrations and fluxes (the same with the elasticities). Both scaled and unscaled coefficients and elasticities are displayed and available for output.<br />

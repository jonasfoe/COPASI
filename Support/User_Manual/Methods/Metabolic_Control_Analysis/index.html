Metabolic control analysis (MCA) is a sensitivity analysis of metabolic systems. In MCA one studies the relative control exerted by each step on the system's variables (e.g. fluxes and species concentrations). This control is measured by applying a perturbation to the step being studied and then measuring the effect on the variable of interest after the system has settled to a new steady state.<br />

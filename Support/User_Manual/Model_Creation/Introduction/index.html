The COPASI graphical user interface has been written using the <a target="_blank" href="http://qt-project.org" rel="external">Qt application framework</a>. This allows us to release COPASI on all platforms that Qt supports.<br />
<br />
It also has the advantage that COPASI essentially behaves the same on all platforms supported, while still showing platform specific behavior. E.g. on a computer running Mac OS X, the user will have the menu at the top of the screen and the menu entry for the about dialog will appear in the COPASI menu rather than the help menu.<br />
<br />
In the following sections, we will explain how to use the graphical user interface of COPASI. Everything should be applicable to all supported platforms. If there is a difference for some platforms we will try to point that out explicitly.<br />

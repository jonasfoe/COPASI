This section discusses the general properties of the model in COPASI and its mathematical interpretation. Generally a model consists of species which are placed in a compartment. Species are produced or consumed by reactions which happen with a speed given by kinetic functions. This model is interpreted mathematically in different ways in COPASI.<br />

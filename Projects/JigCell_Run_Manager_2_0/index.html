Biochemical modeling tools are designed to help modelers build models with a specific set of parameter values.<br />
<br />
However a common scenario involves different parametrization of the same model to account for mutation of the initial model (e.g. gene knock-out, overexpressions). This scenario is not well supported by existing biochemical modeling editors, forcing the user to manually generate, store and maintain big sets of variation of the same model.<br />
<br />
We developed an extension of our modeling editor (MSMB) (<i>Palmisano, A., Hoops, S., Watson, L. T., Jones Jr, T. C., Tyson, J. J., and Shaffer, C. A.(2014). Multistate model builder (MSMB): a flexible editor for compact biochemical models. BMC Systems Biology, 8(1), 42.</i>) called <b>JigCell Run Manager (JC-RM)</b>.<br />
<br />
This extension allows the modeler to define a hierarchy of parameter values, simulation and plot settings and to save them together with the initial model. MSMB-RM allows the generation of simulation plots within the tool, as well as export to COPASI and SBML for further analysis.<br />
<br />
JC-RM offers many innovative features:<br />
<ul><li> graphical interface to define parameter configurations of a single model in a hierarchical way. The different configurations are displayed in a graph and each node typically differs from the others in only minor ways. This makes it easy to define and maintain big sets of small parameter changes;
</li><li> for each node, specific values can be changed either to new numerical values or to complex expressions involving values from ancestor nodes: in this way the propagation of changes from parent nodes to all the descendants is carried seamlessly by the tool;
</li><li> hierarchical graphs can be defined for model's values, simulation runs and plot settings. The different graphs are linked but independent one another;
</li><li> the ensemble of parameter lists, simulation and plotting information can be run inside the tool or exported to a single COPASI file;
</li><li> support in detecting and communicating errors/conflicts that can raise during the definition of configurations (multiple inheritance).
</li></ul>

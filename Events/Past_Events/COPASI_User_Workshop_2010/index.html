Thanks to all participants for a lively and productive meeting!<br />
<br />
<div class="simplebox"><h3>Outline:</h3>The user workshop will provide hands on experience with COPASI's main capabilities. During the 3 day course the participant will learn how to create models within COPASI and how to use COPASI's powerful simulation and analysis features.<br />
<h4 name="Date_">Date:</h4>
July 26 - July 28, 2010<br />
<h4 name="Location_">Location:</h4>
Virginia Bioinformatics Institute<br />

Blacksburg, Va 24061, USA<br />
<br />
The introduction of COPASI's features will be done with known existing models such as the Circadian Clock or Calcium Oscillation. We will use real experimental data from our lab to analyze and fit enzyme kinetic models. Some of the features highlighted during this use case based approach will be:<br />
<ul><li> Stochastic Simulation
</li><li> Sensitivities
</li><li> Scans
</li><li> Optimization
</li><li> Reports
</li><li> Plotting
</li><li> Histograms
</li><li> Batch Processing
</li></ul>
<h4 name="Audience_">Audience:</h4>
The primary target for this workshop are graduate students and scientist in the life science area who are interested in using COPASI as a modeling tool. Prior knowledge of COPASI is not required.<br />
